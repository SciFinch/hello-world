Key things to remember:
Master is the main project, current version
Branches are copies of the master (or other branches), which are used to make changes without accidentally corrupting the master
Commits are the changes made to the branch
Pull requests suggest the changes be incorporated the the next branch up (or master)
Pull requests, once accepted, can then be deleted.
